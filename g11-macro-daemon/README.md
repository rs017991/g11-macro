# g11-macro-daemon
Application that provides Linux support for the macro keys of a Logitech G11 keyboard.

The regular keys (and media keys) of the G11 keyboard operate on a separate interface.
They already work fine in Linux and are not of interest here.

## Features/Behaviour
* Runs in the background as a Linux service
* Reads macro definitions from a user-owned config file
* When a 'G' key is pressed, will execute the associated macro (if configured)
* Supports banking with the 'M' keys, with LED feedback

### Not supported _(yet?)_
* The 'MR' key for recording macros on the fly. (I hardly used this feature in Windows; will add if requested)
* Any kind of GUI for configuring the macros

### G15 Support
Allegedly, the Logitech G15 keyboard uses the same interface as the G11 for its macro keys.
So this application might work for that too, but I have no way of testing this. Worth a shot if you have one.

## Installation/Configuration
* See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)
* See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)

## Key Layout
The macro keys interface covers:
* 18 programmable 'G' keys
* 3 'M' keys that operate as banks for the 'G' keys (allowing for 54 total macros) - _each has its own LED_
* 1 'MR' key that allowed macros to be recorded on the fly - _has its own LED_
* 1 Backlight key that has nothing to do with macros but runs on the same interface
